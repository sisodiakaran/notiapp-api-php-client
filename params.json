Once you have received the request token from Noti, you should redirect your user to the URL provided by Noti.\r\n* Step 2: The user will be displayed a login page and asked if they wish to permit your application to send them notifications. Once they have authorized your application they will be redirected to your application.\r\n* Step 3: When the user has returned to your application, you can exchange the request token for an access token which will be used to authenticate any future requests to the API (for example, whenever you send a notification).\r\n* Step 4 (optional): Send the user a \"welcome\" notification letting them know the authorization process is completed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
